## General Information
- Background 
A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system

- What is the background of your project?
The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?

- What is the dataset that is being used?
day.csv



## Conclusions
####  Comparison of Test Vs Train

####  R-squared Test   :                     0.823
####  R-squared Train  :                     0.820
    
####  Adj. R-squared Test:                   0.814
####  Adj. R-squared Train:                  0.817

####  Main factors influencing the demand 

####  atemp shows linear distribution 
####  season 2 and 3 have a higher median on both working and non working days 
####  It indicates that these seasons can be a good predictor of the dependent variable.
